	<h1>Summary</h1>
	<hr/>
		<p>
			Born and raised in Los Angeles, CA; I graduated from UCLA with a degree in Statistics. Prior to that, I studied at Pasadena City College, a community college nestled in the San Gabriel Mountains majoring in Mathematics, Physics, Natural Sciences, and Engineering. Towards the end of my Bachelor's I realized that I actually enjoyed coding and enrolled at Golden West and Orange Coast College. I really enjoyed the Web Design courses I took, which I'm using to build this website! I also took an introductory Java course and created my first GUI application using JavaFX. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy Statistics. The best part of the major is studying data to create visuals to communicate to the audience. A picture is worth a thousand words and data doesn't inherently lie. It's up to the statistician to make use of their tools to ensure proper measures have been considered. I hope my future ends in the intersection of Statistics and CS. To that end, I will continue the CS sequence at Foothill College through their online curriculum.		
		</p>

			When I'm not at work or studying, you can catch me playing my Nintendo Switch. I also enjoy drawing, although I haven't had a chance to sit down and doodle in quite some time. I'm still working on the kinks on my website, but the Projects and Resume pages will be up soon.
