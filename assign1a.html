				<h2>Summary</h2>
			</header>
		
		<p>
			I was born and raised in <em>Los Angeles, CA</em>. It wasn't until recently that I moved down to <em>Costa Mesa</em> after graduating from<br/>
			university to look for a job. I managed to interview well and was offered a position, but that comes with a relocation prospect.<br/> 
			I enjoy traveling, so I'm really excited about this opportunity. Until my actual starting date later this month, I've been working<br/>
			on different coding aspects since my degree in <em>Statistics</em> only prepares you so much with coding.<br/> 			

			I picked up <b>C++</b> again and managed to reach <em>operator overloading</em> but I need to keep working harder to reach data structures,<br/> 
			a topic foreign to me. I'm enrolled in various classes at <b>GWC</b> and <b>OCC</b> and hope to pick up new skills.
		</p>

			Outside of tech, I'm a huge movie fan. I really enjoy going to the movies and reading about the process of<br/> 
			creating films. I'm also a video game enthusiast, my current system is the <b>Nintendo Switch</b>.<br/>
			Lastly, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, either playing <em>board games</em> or going out shopping!<br/>
			I feel very blessed to enjoy the small moments in life and I'm excited for this semester.
